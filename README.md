# Object Oriented Programming
## What is OOP?

OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.

Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

- OOP is faster and easier to execute
- OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
- OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
- OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

      Tip: The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.

## How OOPs is related to real world?

In OOP a logic is right base on the object with this features
### Abstraction
- When we are making a call it only concatenate about the numbers and display that in screen,we really do not know how this connect with other number.
- We send data from Bluetooth we really do not know how it connect with other phone or devices.

### Encaptulation
- When we turn on the Bluetooth we can assess to connect to other phone but not access to call or send sms from that phone that level is hidden from encapsulation(some of abstraction is available).
- If i connect with kajas phone and kajas connect with sumanie phone ,but i do not have access to connect with sumanie is phone through kajas phone.this kind of hidden will handle by encapsulation.

### Polymorphism
- we are turn on the phone by one button at the same time we can turn off the phone by the same button.

### Inheritance

#### Single level inheritance

- Here some features of mobile is used in Samsung brand.

#### Multi-level inheritance

- S5 have more features than Samsung J1 ,so they use new features with old features.

#### Hierarchical inheritance

- Some of the features may use in two type of brands.

#### Hybrid inheritance

- Some of the features may use in two type of brands, those brands may publish new brands with new features.

#### Multiple inheritance

- Here we can not use abstract class just because their may be duplicate values .that is ,we use interfaces.
But we need to clear that both methods are used abstraction.

## Why we need OOPs in Programming language?
Following two concept is explain everything the use of OOPs.

1. Duplicate code is a Bad.

2. Code will always be changed.

So, above statement proves, OOPs is provides code reusability which reduce the duplication of code because once you have duplicate code, you have make changes everywhere which leads to performance. Code can be changed anytime or requirement of application changed anytime so when you want to make changes in your application, OOPs makes it easier.

### Features of OOPs.

There are three main features of OOPS.

1. ***Abstraction***: Learn abstraction here(PHP 5 Abstract classes and Methods)

2. ***Polymorphism***: is a feature that allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions. Itâ€™s an operation may exhibit different behavior in different instances.

3. ***Inheritance*** : The process by which one class acquires the properties and functionalities of another class. Inheritance provides the idea of reusability of code and each sub class defines only those features that are unique to it.


### Advantages of OOP

Object-Oriented Programming has the following advantages:

- OOP provides a clear modular structure for programs which makes it good for defining abstract datatypes where implementation details are hidden and the unit has a clearly defined interface.
- OOP makes it easy to maintain and modify existing code as new objects can be created with small differences to existing ones.
- OOP provides a good framework for code libraries where supplied software components can be easily adapted and modified by the programmer. This is particularly useful for developing graphical user interfaces.


## Limitations of OOPs
- **Steep learning curve:** The thought process involved in object-oriented programming may not be natural for some people, and it can take time to get used to it. It is complex to create programs based on interaction of objects. Some of the key programming techniques, such as inheritance and polymorphism, can be challenging to comprehend initially.
- **Larger program size:** Object-oriented programs typically involve more lines of code than procedural programs.
- **Slower programs:** Object-oriented programs are typically slower than procedurebased programs, as they typically require more instructions to be executed.
- **Not suitable for all types of problems:** There are problems that lend themselves well to functional-programming style, logic-programming style, or procedure-based programming style, and applying object-oriented programming in those situations will not result in efficient programs.
