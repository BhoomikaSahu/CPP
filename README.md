# Object Oriented Programming
## What is OOP?

OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.

Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

- OOP is faster and easier to execute
- OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
- OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
- OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time
Tip: The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.

## How OOPs is related to real world?

In OOP a logic is right base on the object with this features
### abstraction
- When we are making a call it only concatenate about the numbers and display that in screen,we really do not know how this connect with other number.
- We send data from Bluetooth we really do not know how it connect with other phone or devices.

### Encaptulation
- When we turn on the Bluetooth we can assess to connect to other phone but not access to call or send sms from that phone that level is hidden from encapsulation(some of abstraction is available).
- If i connect with kajas phone and kajas connect with sumanie phone ,but i do not have access to connect with sumanie is phone through kajas phone.this kind of hidden will handle by encapsulation.

### Polymorphism
- we are turn on the phone by one button at the same time we can turn off the phone by the same button.

### Inheritance

#### Single level inheritance

- Here some features of mobile is used in Samsung brand.

#### Multi-level inheritance

- S5 have more features than Samsung J1 ,so they use new features with old features.

#### Hierarchical inheritance

- Some of the features may use in two type of brands.

#### Hybrid inheritance

- Some of the features may use in two type of brands, those brands may publish new brands with new features.

#### Multiple inheritance

- Here we can not use abstract class just because their may be duplicate values .that is ,we use interfaces.
But we need to clear that both methods are used abstraction.
